[.footnoteNumber]# 26.# [[a5377]]XML schema does not
associate anonymous types with a specific symbol space. However,
_nameXmlTransform_ is used since it provides a convenient way to
customize the value class to which an anonymous type is bound.

[.footnoteNumber]# 27.# [[a5378]]There is no need to
standardize the name of the generated class since
_@XmlJavaTypeAdapter.value()_ references the class.

[.footnoteNumber]# 28.# [[a5379]]There is no need to
standardize the name of the generated class since
_@XmlJavaTypeAdapter.value()_ references the class.

[.footnoteNumber]# 29.# [[a5380]]Exception case:
Underscore is not considered a punctuation mark for schema customization
_<jaxb:globalBindings underscoreHandling="asCharInWord"/>_ specified in
link:jaxb.html#a1613[See Underscore Handling]". For this
customization, underscore is considered a special letter that never
results in a word break as defined in link:jaxb.html#a4681[See
XML Word Breaks] and it is definitely not considered an uncased letter.
See example bindings in link:jaxb.html#a4755[See XML Names and
derived Java Class, Method, and Constant Names when <jaxb:globalBindings
underscoreHandling=”asCharInWord”>].

[.footnoteNumber]# 30.# [[a5381]]Sample URN
"urn:hl7-org:v3" \{"h17-org", "v3") transforms to \{"h17.org", "v3"}.
