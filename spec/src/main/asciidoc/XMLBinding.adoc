[.footnoteNumber]# 29.# [[a5380]]Exception case:
Underscore is not considered a punctuation mark for schema customization
_<jaxb:globalBindings underscoreHandling="asCharInWord"/>_ specified in
link:jaxb.html#a1613[See Underscore Handling]". For this
customization, underscore is considered a special letter that never
results in a word break as defined in link:jaxb.html#a4681[See
XML Word Breaks] and it is definitely not considered an uncased letter.
See example bindings in link:jaxb.html#a4755[See XML Names and
derived Java Class, Method, and Constant Names when <jaxb:globalBindings
underscoreHandling=”asCharInWord”>].

"urn:hl7-org:v3" \{"h17-org", "v3") transforms to \{"h17.org", "v3"}.
